-=| TO DO |=-

* sitemap

* faciliate deployment (script?)

* own mail server?

* events loose 'contact' when editing. (not always???)

* participants in activities:
** give px margin right (is already there but sometimes missing??)
** place under map
** limit number ?

* integrate spinners

* make user list sortable (username, real name, ...)

* auto-login after signup

* make about items configurable

** IE <10 : try out placeholder fix

-=| PROBABLY NOT |=-

* use real languages and not nationalities as languages
** there is probably a race condition so that if two ppl sign up for an activity almost simultanousliy they may exceed the limit. - check limit in server again when singing up
* statistics
* waiting list for limited activities
* squeeze in more columns in pdf / smaller font etc.
* "close signup"-switch for activities
* flag for early bird-option?
* flag for t-shirt handed???

* bugs
** (/) language picker does not work when editing profile or signup. page loading takes very long -> combination of angular batarang and ui-select2

* inter-browser issues
** chrome on iphone seems to mess with the menu??

* compress background to improve loading time
